## Description

In order to maintain inventory for an e-commerce store, I needed to create an application that would store inventory and related data in a mysql database and could be easily retrieved and updated.

This application utilizes sequelize in tandem with express to connect the user to the mysql database. 
It was important for me to understand how sequelize connects to a database and perform operations without the use of rawsql. It was also necessary for me to update the routes via express.

## Installation

In order to run this application you will need to install sequelize, dotenv, express, and mysql2. The dependencies are included in the package.json and can be installed by running npm i in the console. In addidtion, the application will need to use an API development platform such as insomnia to complete requests as there is no user interface.

## Usage

In order to use the program, you will need to make requests using an API development platform to send GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE routes to the application to update the database. Proper request formats for the POST routes have been commented in the routes files. The link below will take you to a video demonstration of the apps functionality.
